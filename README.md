This playbook uses the awscli package to configure the AWS CLI with your AWS access and secret keys. It then uses the kops tool to create a Kubernetes cluster on AWS. This cluster will have one master node and two worker nodes, each using t2.micro instance types.

You will need to modify the --name, --state, --ssh-public-key, and --zones parameters to match your desired configuration. You may also want to modify the instance types or the number of worker nodes, depending on your needs.

Here's how you can run the playbook:

Copy code
`ansible-playbook create_kubernetes_cluster.yml`
Make sure that you have your AWS access and secret keys handy and that you update the Ansible playbook to match your desired configuration before running it.


design a ansible script to install Kubernetes in ubuntu 
Sure! Here's an example Ansible playbook that you can use to install Kubernetes on Ubuntu:

yaml
Copy code
---
- hosts: all
  become: true
  vars:
    k8s_version: "1.21.5-00"
  tasks:
    - name: Add Kubernetes APT repository
      apt_repository:
        repo: deb https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main
        state: present
        filename: kubernetes
        update_cache: yes
        cache_valid_time: 3600
        keyserver: keyserver.ubuntu.com
        key_id: 6A030B21BA07F4FB

    - name: Install Kubernetes tools
      apt:
        name: "{{ item }}"
        state: latest
      loop:
        - kubelet={{ k8s_version }}
        - kubectl={{ k8s_version }}
        - kubeadm={{ k8s_version }}

    - name: Initialize Kubernetes cluster
      command: kubeadm init --apiserver-advertise-address={{ hostvars[groups['kube-master'][0]]['ansible_default_ipv4']['address'] }}
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['kube-master']

    - name: Copy Kubernetes configuration
      command: "{{ item }}"
      loop:
        - mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
        - cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
        - chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config
      become_user: "{{ ansible_ssh_user }}"
      when: inventory_hostname in groups['kube-master']
This playbook assumes that you have three hosts in your inventory file: one designated as the Kubernetes master node and two worker nodes. You will need to modify the inventory file accordingly.

Here's how you can run the playbook:

css
Copy code
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini kubernetes.yaml
Replace inventory.ini with the name of your inventory file and kubernetes.yaml with the name of the playbook file.

I hope this helps you get started with installing Kubernetes on Ubuntu using Ansible!



nishu raj
show me the sample inventory file
Certainly! Here's an example inventory file for the Ansible playbook I provided earlier:

csharp
Copy code
[kube-master]
k8s-master ansible_host=192.168.1.100

[kube-workers]
k8s-worker-1 ansible_host=192.168.1.101
k8s-worker-2 ansible_host=192.168.1.102

[kube-cluster:children]
kube-master
kube-workers
This inventory file contains three sections:

[kube-master]: Contains the hostname and IP address of the Kubernetes master node. In this example, the hostname is k8s-master and the IP address is 192.168.1.100.
[kube-workers]: Contains the hostnames and IP addresses of the Kubernetes worker nodes. In this example, there are two worker nodes: k8s-worker-1 with IP address 192.168.1.101, and k8s-worker-2 with IP address 192.168.1.102.
[kube-cluster:children]: Groups the kube-master and kube-workers groups together to form a parent group called kube-cluster.
You can modify this inventory file to match the hostnames and IP addresses of your own Kubernetes nodes. Make sure that you update the Ansible playbook to match your inventory file before running it.
