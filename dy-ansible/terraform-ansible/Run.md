Certainly! You can use Ansible to automate the execution of Terraform scripts. This is typically done using the `command` or `shell` modules to run the Terraform commands. Here's an example playbook that demonstrates how to do this:

```yaml
---
- name: Execute Terraform
  hosts: your_target_hosts
  become: yes

  tasks:
    - name: Install unzip (if not already installed)
      package:
        name: unzip
        state: present

    - name: Download and extract Terraform
      command: "curl -LO https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.15.4/terraform_0.15.4_linux_amd64.zip && unzip terraform_0.15.4_linux_amd64.zip"
      args:
        chdir: /usr/local/bin
      environment:
        PATH: "{{ ansible_env.PATH }}:/usr/local/bin"

    - name: Check Terraform version
      command: "terraform --version"
      register: terraform_version_output

    - name: Run Terraform init
      command: "terraform init"
      args:
        chdir: /path/to/your/terraform/project

    - name: Run Terraform plan
      command: "terraform plan"
      args:
        chdir: /path/to/your/terraform/project

    - name: Apply Terraform changes
      command: "terraform apply -auto-approve"
      args:
        chdir: /path/to/your/terraform/project
```

In this example playbook:

1. The playbook first ensures that `unzip` is installed on the target hosts.
2. It then downloads and extracts the Terraform binary.
3. It checks the Terraform version to verify the installation.
4. Next, it initializes the Terraform project.
5. It runs a plan to see what changes would be made.
6. Finally, it applies the Terraform changes, using `-auto-approve` to automatically approve the changes.

Remember to replace `your_target_hosts` with the actual target hosts where you want to run the Terraform commands. Also, replace `/path/to/your/terraform/project` with the actual path to your Terraform project.

Please ensure that you have appropriate permissions to run these commands on your target hosts. Additionally, always exercise caution when using `terraform apply` as it can make changes to your infrastructure.

Before executing this playbook, make sure you have Ansible and Terraform installed on the machine from where you'll be running this playbook. Additionally, please verify the paths and version numbers to ensure they match your specific setup.
